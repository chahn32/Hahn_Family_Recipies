*Prep: 20 min | Cook: 1 hr 15 min | Total: 1 hr 35 min | Serves: 8*

**Nutrition (per serving with toast):** 485 cal | 24g fat | 38g carbs | 28g protein

**Full Stock:**
- 2700g (3 boxes/11 cups) beef stock
- 900g (2 lb) 90/10 ground beef

**Quick Stock:**
- 2700g beef stock
- 30g (2 tablespoons) Better Than Bouillon beef
- 3 packets gelatin

**Soup:**
- 2500g onions (7 medium), sliced
- 115g (½ cup) butter
- 60g (¼ cup) water
- Salt
- ~1000g (4 cups) water for deglazing
- 2g thyme
- 5g black pepper
- 10g flour
- 150g dry sherry
- 25g Worcestershire sauce
- 2500g beef stock
- 0.5g MSG (optional)

**Cheesy Toast:**
- 8 slices sourdough bread
- 30g oil or butter
- 150g Gruyère cheese, grated
- 8 slices provolone cheese

**Instructions:**
1. Pressure-cook beef and stock 25-30 minutes, then strain (or whisk together quick stock ingredients)
2. Slice onions into 1.5-inch strips
3. Place pot on medium-high heat, add butter, onions, water, and big pinch of salt; cover 5 minutes
4. Stir, uncover, and cook 5 more minutes until soft and lightly colored
5. Lower to medium heat, cook 30 minutes stirring and scraping often
6. As fond builds, lower heat slightly and deglaze repeatedly with water until onions are deep brown and jammy
7. Add thyme, pepper, and flour; stir 30 seconds
8. Add sherry, reduce 3-5 minutes until nearly dry
9. Add Worcestershire, stock, and MSG; simmer 15 minutes
10. Season aggressively with salt
11. Fry bread, top with cheeses, broil until bubbly
12. Serve soup with 1-2 cheesy toasts and black pepper

**Notes:**
- Full stock adds incredible depth of flavor but quick stock is a good shortcut
- The key to great French onion soup is deeply caramelized onions - don't rush this step
- Can be made 2-3 days ahead and reheated
