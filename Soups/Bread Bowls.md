# Bread Bowls

*Prep: 20 min | Rise: 3 hrs | Bake: 35 min | Makes: 4 bowls*

**Nutrition (per bread bowl):** 380 cal | 4g fat | 72g carbs | 14g protein

**Ingredients:**
- 360g (1½ cups) warm water
- 3g (1 teaspoon) active dry yeast
- 15g (1 tablespoon) vinegar
- 110g ripe poolish
- 550g (4½ cups) bread flour
- 11g (2 teaspoons) salt

**Instructions:**
1. Mix all ingredients to form fully combined dough
2. Rest 30 minutes, stretch and fold; rest 30 minutes, repeat; rest 1 hour
3. Divide into 4 pieces (~250g each), shape into tight balls
4. Cover and proof 60-90 minutes
5. Mist with water, score tops, bake on 460°F preheated baking stone covered 15 minutes
6. Uncover, rotate, bake 20 minutes more until deep golden brown
7. Cool completely, cut off tops and hollow out centers
8. Fill with hot soup and serve immediately

**Notes:**
- Poolish is a pre-ferment made from equal parts flour and water plus a pinch of yeast, fermented 8-12 hours
- If you don't have poolish, increase flour by 55g and water by 55g
- Baking covered (with inverted pot or Dutch oven) creates steam for better crust
- Hollowed bread can be toasted lightly in oven before filling
- Save bread scraps for croutons or breadcrumbs
