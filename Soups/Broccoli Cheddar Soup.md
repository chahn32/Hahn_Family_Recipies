*Prep: 15 min | Cook: 25 min | Total: 40 min | Serves: 6*

**Nutrition (per serving):** 420 cal | 30g fat | 24g carbs | 16g protein

**Ingredients:**
- 75g (⅓ cup) olive oil
- 350g (2 medium) onion, diced
- 125g (1 medium) carrot, diced
- 125g fennel, diced
- 350g (2 medium) potatoes, diced
- 20g (5 cloves) garlic, minced
- 400g (4 cups) broccoli florets
- Salt
- 50g (⅓ cup) flour
- 1500g (6 cups) chicken stock
- 250g (1 cup) heavy cream
- 225g (2 cups) cheddar cheese, shredded
- Black pepper

**Instructions:**
1. Heat oil in large pot over medium-high, add all vegetables and salt; sweat 6-7 minutes
2. Add flour, stir and cook 2 minutes
3. Add stock and cream; simmer 10-15 minutes until potatoes are just tender
4. Blend 3-4 cups of soup until smooth; return to pot
5. Remove from heat, add cheddar, stir until melted and smooth
6. Taste, season, serve with black pepper

**Notes:**
- Blending only part of the soup gives nice texture while keeping it creamy
- Add cheese off heat to prevent it from becoming grainy
- Fennel adds a subtle sweetness - can substitute with more celery if preferred
- Soup thickens as it sits; thin with additional stock or cream if needed
