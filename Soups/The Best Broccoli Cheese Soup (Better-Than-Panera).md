**Ingredients:**
- 1 tablespoon + 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
- 1 small/medium sweet yellow onion, diced small
- 1 clove garlic, minced finely
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 cups low-sodium vegetable stock (or chicken)
- 2 cups half-and-half
- 2-3 cups broccoli florets, diced bite-size + 1 cup stems (optional)
- 2 large carrots, sliced into very thin rounds
- ¾ teaspoon salt (or to taste)
- ¾ teaspoon black pepper (or to taste)
- ½ teaspoon smoked or regular paprika (optional)
- ½ teaspoon dry mustard powder (optional)
- Pinch cayenne pepper (optional)
- 8 ounces grated high-quality extra-sharp cheddar (reserve some for garnish)

**Instructions:**
1. In small saucepan, sauté onion in 1 tablespoon butter over medium until translucent and barely browned, about 4 minutes
2. Add garlic, cook 30 seconds, stirring constantly. Remove from heat
3. In large heavy-bottom pot, add 4 tablespoons butter and flour. Cook over medium, whisking constantly, 3-5 minutes until thickened (making a roux)
4. Slowly add vegetable stock, whisking constantly
5. Slowly add half-and-half, whisking constantly
6. Simmer over low 15-20 minutes until reduced and thickened. Whisk intermittently
7. While simmering, chop broccoli and carrots
8. After 15-20 minutes, add broccoli, carrots, and the onion/garlic mixture
9. Add salt, pepper, and optional seasonings. Stir
10. Simmer over low 20-25 minutes until reduced and thickened. Whisk intermittently
11. While simmering, grate cheese (must be freshly grated, not pre-packaged)
12. After 20-25 minutes, add most of cheese (reserve some for garnish). Stir until melted, less than 1 minute
13. Transfer to bowls, garnish with reserved cheese, serve immediately

**Notes:**
- Whole or 2% milk can substitute but won't be as creamy
- Use high-quality cheese, not pre-grated
- Soup keeps 5-7 days in fridge
- Reheat gently in microwave (less likely to break than stovetop)
- Not recommended for freezing
