# Pork Steak Casserole

*Simple pork steak casserole*

## Ingredients

- 1 pound pork shoulder steak, cut in 1-inch cubes
- Brown steak on all sides in 2 tablespoons season (1 teaspoon salt, ⅛ teaspoon pepper)
- 1 can chicken (rice soup?)
- 1 can water
- ½ cup chopped celery
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 1-4 ounces can mushrooms (optional)
- 4 ounces uncooked medium noodles

## Instructions

1. Thoroughly add remaining ingredients and mix thoroughly
2. Turn into casserole. Cover and bake 1 hour at 350°
3. I bake this with the lid on the casserole to keep the cheese from getting too brown, especially good with grilled, pearl and green salad

## Notes

- Some text on original recipe card is difficult to read due to age
- "Season" likely refers to seasoning mix or seasoned salt
- Soup type unclear - possibly cream of chicken with rice
