# Red Wine-Braised Beef Short Ribs

*Active: 2 hrs | Cook: 5 hrs | Total: 5 hrs | Serves: 4*

**Ingredients:**
- 5 pounds beef short ribs
- Kosher salt and black pepper
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 2 celery ribs, cut into ½-inch dice
- 2 large carrots, cut into ½-inch dice
- 1 large yellow onion, cut into ½-inch dice
- 5 medium cloves garlic, smashed
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 (750ml) bottle dry red wine
- 1 quart beef or chicken stock
- 1 packet gelatin (if using store-bought stock)
- 4 sprigs fresh thyme
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 (750ml) bottle ruby port wine
- Slurry: ½ tsp cornstarch + 1 tsp water (optional)

**Instructions:**
1. Preheat oven to 300°F. Season short ribs with salt and pepper
2. Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium-high. Brown ribs on all sides, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to platter
3. Leave 2 tablespoons fat in pot. Add celery, carrot, onion, and garlic. Cook until browned, about 6 minutes
4. Stir in tomato paste and cook 1 minute longer
5. Add red wine, scraping up browned bits. Bring to simmer
6. Add stock (if store-bought, bloom gelatin in it first)
7. Return ribs and juices to pot, nestling into liquid. Add thyme and bay leaves
8. Cover partially and transfer to oven. Cook until fork-tender, 2-3 hours
9. Meanwhile, gently simmer port in saucepan until syrupy, about 1 hour (should yield ½ cup)
10. Remove ribs to platter and tent with foil
11. Skim fat from braising liquid. Strain through fine-mesh strainer, pressing on solids. Discard solids
12. Return liquid to pot and simmer until reduced to 2 cups, about 1 hour. Skim foam
13. Add port reduction to braising liquid
14. If sauce is thin, whisk in cornstarch slurry and simmer until thickened
15. Season with salt and pepper. Return ribs to pot, spooning sauce over to glaze
16. Serve

**Notes:**
- Look for well-marbled short ribs with at least 1½ inches of meat above bones
- Can refrigerate in sauce for up to 5 days
