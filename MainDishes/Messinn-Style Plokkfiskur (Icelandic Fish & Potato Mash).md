title: Messinn-Style Plokkfiskur (Icelandic Fish & Potato Mash)
category: Main Dishes
tags: [main-dishes, main-course]
prep_time: 15 min
cook_time: 20 min*

**Ingredients:**
- 1 lb (500g) fresh cod or haddock, flaked
- 1 lb (500g) Yukon Gold potatoes, boiled and cubed
- 1 medium yellow onion, finely diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1½ cups whole milk (or half & half for extra creaminess)
- ½ teaspoon yellow curry powder
- Salt and white pepper to taste
- 1 cup shredded Gouda or Havarti cheese
- Fresh lime wedges and chopped chives for serving

**Instructions:**
1. **Prepare the Base:** Poach the fish in lightly salted water for 5-8 minutes until it flakes. Drain and set aside. Boil potatoes until tender, peel, and cut into ½-inch cubes
2. **Sauté Aromatics:** In a heavy skillet (cast iron preferred), melt the butter over medium heat. Sauté the onion until translucent. Add garlic and curry powder, stirring for 30 seconds
3. **Make the Béchamel:** Sprinkle flour over the onions and stir for 1 minute to cook out the raw flour taste. Slowly whisk in the milk until the sauce is thick and smooth
4. **Fold & Season:** Gently fold in the flaked fish and cubed potatoes. Be careful not to over-mash; you want some texture. Season generously with salt and white pepper
5. **The Gratin Finish:** Top with the shredded cheese. Place the skillet under the oven broiler for 3-5 minutes until the top is golden brown and bubbling
6. **Serve:** Add a squeeze of lime and serve immediately with dark rye bread and a thick slab of salted butter

**Notes:**
- Cast iron skillet works best for this dish
- Don't over-mash - maintaining some texture is key to authentic plokkfiskur
- Can substitute other firm white fish if cod/haddock unavailable
