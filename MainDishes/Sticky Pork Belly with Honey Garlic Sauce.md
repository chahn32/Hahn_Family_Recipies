# Sticky Pork Belly with Honey Garlic Sauce

*Prep: 10-15 min | Cook: 10-15 min | Total: 20-30 min | Serves: 4*

**For the pork belly:**
- 1 lb pork belly, cut into 1-inch thick slices
- Salt, to taste

**For the sauce:**
- ¼ cup honey
- 3 tablespoons tamari or soy sauce
- 4 garlic cloves, minced

**For the garnish:**
- 2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds
- 2 green onions, chopped

**Instructions:**
1. Slice the pork belly into small, cube-like pieces. Trim off any extra fat if desired
2. Add the pork belly to a large pan over high heat (no oil needed - it will render its own fat)
3. Move the slices constantly at first to prevent sticking. Cook about 5 minutes on one side
4. Flip and cook another 5 minutes on the other side at high-medium heat. Use a splatter screen
5. The pork should become crispy and browned. Reduce heat to medium if pan gets too hot
6. Once done, remove pork belly to a plate. Dispose of any extra fat from pan
7. In the same pan, add honey, tamari sauce, and minced garlic. Stir well
8. Heat sauce until it starts to boil, then reduce heat and cook 1 minute, stirring continuously
9. Remove pan from heat to let it cool slightly
10. Stir in 1 tablespoon sesame seeds to the sauce
11. Add pork belly back to pan, coating each piece well in the sticky sauce
12. Sprinkle remaining sesame seeds on top and finish with chopped green onions
13. Serve immediately over rice

**Notes:**
- Don't overcrowd the pan; fry in batches if needed
- Use stainless steel pan to avoid sticking
- Store leftovers in fridge up to 3 days or freeze up to 2 months
- Reheat in pan over medium heat with a splash of water if sauce is too thick
