## Notes

- **Monday motivation**: Omega-3s for brain power. 35g protein + heart-healthy fats!
- Salmon is done when it reaches 145°F internal temperature
- For extra glaze, simmer remaining balsamic mixture in a pan until reduced by half
- Works great with green beans, broccoli, or brussels sprouts instead of asparagus
