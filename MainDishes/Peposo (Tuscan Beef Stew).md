# Peposo (Tuscan Beef Stew)

*Prep: 5 min | Cook: 3 hrs | Total: 3 hrs 5 min | Serves: 4-6*

**Ingredients:**
- 2½ pounds chuck roast, cut into chunks
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 8 cloves garlic
- 1 (750ml) bottle Chianti
- 1½ tablespoons coarse black pepper, crushed

**Instructions:**
1. Pat beef very dry with paper towels. Season with salt on all sides
2. Heat Dutch oven to medium. Add olive oil and garlic, cook 1-2 minutes until lightly golden. Remove garlic (save for later)
3. Add beef without crowding (work in batches). Sear on all sides, about 5-6 minutes total. Place on plate
4. Add black pepper to oil, cook 30 seconds
5. Turn heat to medium-high, add wine. Once bubbling, scrape brown bits from bottom
6. Let wine bubble 2-3 minutes, then reduce to medium-low
7. Return beef and garlic to pot. Cover with lid
8. Cook 90 minutes covered, then remove lid and cook 60-90 minutes more until tender (stir occasionally)
9. Once tender, can remove meat and reduce liquid by boiling if desired
10. Serve with crusty Italian bread, polenta, or mashed potatoes

**Notes:**
- Makes 4 large or 6 moderate servings
- Cooking time varies - cook until very tender but not falling apart
- Sauce is traditionally thin; thicken with cornstarch if preferred
- Better the next day
- Leftovers keep 3 days in fridge
