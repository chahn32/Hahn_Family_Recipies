# Mom's Apple Crisp

*(Hot)*

**Ingredients:**
- 4 to 6 large Granny Smith apples
- 8 graham cracker squares (2 1/2 inches each)

**Topping:**
- 1/4 cup flour
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/4 cup butter or margarine, melted

**Gravy (Optional):**
- 1/2 cup butter
- 3/4 cup packed brown sugar
- 1/4 cup creamy peanut sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
- 1/4 cup cream
- 2 medium Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, and sliced

**Instructions:**
*For the Crisp:*
1. Preheat oven to 375°F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. On a lightly floured surface unfold one sheet of puff pastry. Using a 3" round cookie cutter, cut out circles. Repeat with other sheet
2. Place half the circles on prepared baking sheet and place a caramel square in center of each. Top with remaining puff pastry circles and crimp edges with a fork
3. In a small bowl, combine sugar and cinnamon. Brush cookies with melted butter and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar
4. Bake until golden and puff pastry is cooked through, 15 minutes
5. Meanwhile make dipping sauce: Place chocolate chips in a medium heat-safe bowl. In a small saucepan over medium heat, heat cream until just simmering. Pour cream over chocolate chips and let sit for 2 minutes. Whisk until smooth. Let cool slightly
6. Serve cookies with ganache for dipping

*Note: Recipe seems to combine Apple Crisp and Caramel Puff Pastry instructions - keeping both*
