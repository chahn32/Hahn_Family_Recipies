# Apple Pie Enchiladas

**Nutrition (per serving, 6 servings):** 385 cal | 18g fat | 54g carbs | 3g protein

**Ingredients:**
- 1 (21 ounce) can apple pie filling
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 cup butter
- 1/2 cup white sugar
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 1/2 cup water
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 6 (8 inch) flour tortillas - store bought is great for this, just be sure to buy Flour Tortillas

**Instructions:**
1. Spoon about one heaping quarter cup of pie filling evenly down the center of each tortilla. Sprinkle with cinnamon and roll up, tucking in edges; and place seam side down in prepared dish
2. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar and water. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly; reduce heat and simmer 3 minutes, remove from heat and stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla
3. Pour sauce over enchiladas and let stand 45 minutes. Note: Don't rush the 45 minute resting time for the sauce on the enchiladas before baking, this step helps to magically transform the flour tortillas into a faux pasty dough
4. Bake in preheated oven at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes, or until golden

*~Enjoy~*
