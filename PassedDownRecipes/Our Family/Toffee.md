# Toffee

*Preparing toffee isn't complicated, but it does require a candy thermometer, so the candy hardens at just the right temperature and doesn't burn. This version includes the typical American toffee ingredients, granulated sugar and butter, with the addition of chocolate and nuts. For a more festive holiday treat, sprinkle the top with a little flaky salt or some crushed candy canes, and double or triple this recipe for gifting.*

## Ingredients

- 1 cup (227g) unsalted butter, cut into 2-inch cubes
- 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
- 1 cup semisweet or milk chocolate chips
- ½ cup pecans or almonds, finely chopped

## Instructions

1. Line a 9-by-9-inch baking pan with parchment, creating a little overhang for easier lift

2. Attach a candy thermometer to a medium (3-quart) heavy saucepan, making sure the thermometer isn't touching the bottom. Add the butter, sugar and salt to the pan over medium heat, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, until the mixture comes to a boil, about 10 minutes

3. Once boiling, stir constantly, making sure to scrape down the sides of the pot, until the temperature reaches 300°F (known as the hard crack stage), about 10 minutes. The color will turn from pale yellow to a light caramel, and the mixture will thicken

4. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract, if using. (The vanilla will hiss when added to hot mixture.) Pour into the prepared pan, spreading in an even layer with a rubber or offset spatula. Evenly scatter the chocolate chips on top; let sit for 1 minute. With the spatula, smooth the chocolate over the top. Sprinkle the nuts all over the chocolate layer. Refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours

5. Using the parchment overhang, lift the toffee out of the baking pan and place it on a cutting board. Cut or break it into pieces. If not immediately serving, toffee can be stored in an airtight container in a cool place for up to 3 weeks

## Notes

- A candy thermometer is essential for this recipe
- Use a deep, heavy saucepan to help the sugar evenly melt
- The mixture reaches 300°F at the "hard crack stage"
- For festive variations, sprinkle with flaky salt or crushed candy canes
- Can double or triple recipe for gifting
