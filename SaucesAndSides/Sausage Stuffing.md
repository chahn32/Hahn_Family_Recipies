# Sausage Stuffing

*Serves: 8-10*

**Ingredients:**
- 10 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided (plus more for dish)
- 1-1¼ lb loaf country-style white bread, torn into 1" pieces
- 1 lb breakfast sausage, casings removed
- 2 medium onions, finely chopped
- 6 celery stalks, finely chopped
- 8 garlic cloves, coarsely chopped
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt (or 1¾ tsp Morton salt)
- 1 teaspoon fennel seeds (optional)
- 3 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth, divided
- ½ cup packed coarsely chopped parsley
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped sage
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped thyme
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground pepper
- 3 large eggs

**Instructions:**
1. Preheat oven to 350°F with rack in middle. Grease 13x9" baking dish
2. Arrange bread in single layer on rimmed baking sheet. Bake until dried and golden, 30-40 minutes. Cool
3. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in Dutch oven over medium-high. Cook sausage, breaking into small pieces, until browned and cooked through, 8-10 minutes. Transfer to plate, leaving fat
4. Reduce to medium, add remaining 8 tablespoons butter to fat and melt
5. Cook onions, celery, garlic, salt, and fennel seeds (if using), stirring occasionally, until onions softened and golden, 12-15 minutes
6. Remove from heat, stir in 2 cups broth, sausage, parsley, sage, thyme, and pepper
7. Whisk eggs and remaining 1 cup broth in small bowl. Stir into pot
8. Add bread and toss gently to combine. Let sit, tossing occasionally, until liquid almost completely absorbed, about 10 minutes
9. Transfer to prepared dish (don't pack down). Cover loosely with foil
10. Place on rimmed baking sheet and bake until hot throughout (160°F), 35-45 minutes
11. Increase oven to 400°F, remove foil
12. Bake until light golden on top, 25-30 minutes longer

**Do Ahead:**
- Bread can be baked 1 day ahead
- Stuffing can be assembled 1 day ahead; chill. Bring to room temp before baking
