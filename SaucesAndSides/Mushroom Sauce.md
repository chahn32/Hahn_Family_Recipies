# Mushroom Sauce

*Prep: 8 min | Cook: 12 min | Total: 20 min | Serves: 4*

**Ingredients:**
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- ½ tablespoon olive oil
- 300g (10 oz) mushrooms, sliced
- Pinch of salt and pepper
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- ¼ cup (65ml) white wine or rosé, dry
- ½ cup (125ml) chicken or vegetable broth
- 1 cup (250ml) heavy/thickened cream
- ½ cup Parmesan, finely grated (30g/1 oz)
- 2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves (or ¼-½ tsp dried)

**Instructions:**
1. Heat oil and melt butter in skillet over medium-high
2. Add mushrooms and cook until golden brown, about 4-5 minutes
3. Before done, add garlic, salt, and pepper. Cook until garlic golden, about 1 minute
4. Add wine - it will sizzle. Stir, scraping bottom, for 1 minute until mostly evaporated
5. Add broth, cream, and Parmesan. Stir, then lower to medium so sauce simmers (don't boil rapidly)
6. Simmer 2-3 minutes until thickened. Sauce shouldn't be super thick
7. Stir through thyme, adjust salt and pepper
8. Serve over steak, chicken, pasta, baked potatoes, etc.

**Notes:**
- Use fine grater for Parmesan to ensure it melts properly
- To lighten: use low-fat thickened cream mixed with 1 tsp cornstarch
- Makes enough for 4-5 steaks or 250g pasta
