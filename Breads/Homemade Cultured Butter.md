# Homemade Cultured Butter

*Prep: 15 min | Culture: 24-48 hours | Makes: 200g (7 oz)*

**Ingredients:**
- 1 pint (2 cups) heavy cream (highest quality, no stabilizers)
- 2 tablespoons plain whole-milk yogurt (with live cultures)
- ¼ teaspoon sea salt (optional)

**Instructions:**
1. Pour cream into a jar or bowl
2. Add yogurt and stir gently until well combined
3. Cover jar/bowl with clean towel and secure with rubber band
4. Set in warm spot (around 70-75°F) for 24-48 hours
5. Check often and taste for flavor - you want a nice sour flavor (intensity is up to you)
6. Once cultured to your liking, refrigerate until chilled (at least 1-2 hours)
7. Pour cultured cream into stand mixer with whisk attachment
8. Beat on medium-high speed until buttermilk separates from butter (mixture will go from whipped cream to grainy with liquid)
9. Line strainer with cheesecloth over bowl. Strain to separate butter from buttermilk
10. Save buttermilk for baking (store in fridge)
11. Place butter in bowl of ice-cold water
12. Use hands to squeeze and knead butter to remove remaining buttermilk
13. Change water several times until water stays clear
14. Continue squeezing and kneading on clean, dry surface, wiping surface to remove moisture
15. Transfer to clean tea towel and squeeze to remove as much moisture as possible
16. If using salt, knead it in evenly with dough scraper
17. Shape butter into log or portions as desired
18. Wrap in greaseproof paper or place in butter dish
19. Refrigerate to chill and set

**Notes:**
- Washing butter thoroughly is critical - any remaining buttermilk can cause butter to go rancid
- Use cream without stabilizers or emulsifiers for best results
- Store in refrigerator up to 3 weeks or freeze up to 3 months
- Saved buttermilk is real traditional buttermilk - use in baking for best results
- Can use buttermilk from previous batch to culture next batch
