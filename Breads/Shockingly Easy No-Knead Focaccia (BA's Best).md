# Shockingly Easy No-Knead Focaccia (BA's Best)

*Prep: 15 min | Rest: 8 hours - 1 day | Cook: 25-30 min | Serves: 8-10*

**Ingredients:**
- 1 (¼-oz) envelope active dry yeast (about 2¼ teaspoons)
- 2 teaspoons honey
- 2½ cups lukewarm water
- 5 cups (625g) all-purpose flour
- 5 teaspoons Diamond Crystal or 1 tablespoon Morton kosher salt
- 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided, plus more for hands
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for pan
- 2-4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced (optional)
- Flaky sea salt
- Dried or fresh herbs (optional - rosemary, thyme, etc.)

**Instructions:**
1. Whisk yeast, honey, and 2½ cups lukewarm water in medium bowl. Let sit 5 minutes until foamy/creamy
2. Add flour and salt. Mix with rubber spatula until shaggy dough forms and no dry streaks remain
3. Pour 4 tablespoons olive oil into large bowl that fits in refrigerator
4. Transfer dough to bowl and turn to coat in oil
5. Cover with silicone lid or plastic wrap
6. Chill until dough doubles in size and looks very bubbly, at least 8 hours and up to 1 day
7. Generously butter 13x9" baking pan (for thick focaccia) or 18x13" rimmed baking sheet (for thinner focaccia)
8. Pour 1 tablespoon oil into center of pan
9. Keeping dough in bowl, gather edges farthest from you and lift up and over into center
10. Repeat three more times, turning bowl 90 degrees each time (this gently deflates dough)
11. Transfer dough to prepared pan. Pour remaining 2 tablespoons oil over dough
12. Using floured hands, gently stretch dough to fit pan. If dough springs back, let rest 10 minutes and try again
13. Cover with dish towel and let rise in warm, dry spot until doubled in size, 1½-4 hours
14. Preheat oven to 450°F with rack in middle
15. Using 2-3 fingers, dimple dough all over, pressing down firmly
16. If using garlic, nestle slices into dimples
17. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt and herbs if desired
18. Bake until golden brown all over, 25-30 minutes
19. Transfer to wire rack and let cool slightly
20. Drizzle with more olive oil if desired. Serve warm or room temperature

**Notes:**
- Don't skip the overnight fermentation - it develops flavor and texture
- Dough will be very wet and sticky - this is correct
- For thicker sandwich-style focaccia, use 13x9" pan
- For thinner focaccia perfect for dipping, use 18x13" sheet
- Can add toppings: olives, cherry tomatoes, caramelized onions, cheese
- Focaccia keeps at room temperature 2 days or refrigerated 5 days
