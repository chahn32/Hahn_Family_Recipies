# Cheddar Biscuits (Red Lobster Style)

*Prep: 20 min | Cook: 20 min | Total: 40 min | Yields: 8-10 biscuits*

**Ingredients:**
- 2½ cups all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled), plus more for hands and work surface
- 1 tablespoon baking powder (aluminum-free)
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cubed and very cold
- 1 cup + 2 tablespoons cold buttermilk, divided
- 2 teaspoons honey
- 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese

**For the Topping:**
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon dried or fresh chopped parsley

**Instructions:**
1. Preheat oven to 425°F
2. Place flour, baking powder, baking soda, garlic powder, and salt in large bowl. Whisk to combine
3. Add cubed butter and cut into dry ingredients with pastry cutter until coarse crumbs form
4. Fold in shredded cheese
5. Make well in center. Pour 1 cup buttermilk and drizzle honey on top
6. Fold everything together until it begins to come together (dough will be shaggy and crumbly)
7. Pour dough onto floured surface and gently bring together with floured hands
8. Flatten into ¾-inch-thick rectangle. Fold one side to center, then other side on top
9. Turn dough horizontally. Flatten to ¾-inch thick again
10. Repeat folding 2 more times, flattening between each fold
11. Cut into 2.5- or 3-inch circles with biscuit cutter (don't twist cutter)
12. Arrange in 10-inch cast iron skillet or close together on lined baking sheet (biscuits should be touching)
13. Brush tops with remaining buttermilk
14. Bake 18-22 minutes until tops are golden brown
15. Mix topping ingredients. Brush on warm biscuits immediately
16. Serve warm

**Notes:**
- Keep butter very cold - freeze cubed butter 15 minutes before using
- Don't twist biscuit cutter when cutting - this seals edges and prevents rising
- Biscuits rise taller when snugly arranged together
- Store at room temperature or in fridge up to 5 days
- Can freeze baked biscuits up to 3 months
