# Rustic Bread (No-Knead Dutch Oven)

*Prep: 4 hrs 40 min | Cook: 40 min | Serves: 8 slices*
**Ingredients:**
- 3⅓ cups (434g) bread flour
- 1 packet (2¼ teaspoons) active dry yeast
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1⅔ cups (395ml) warm water, 110°F

**Instructions:**
1. In a large bowl, whisk together bread flour, yeast, and salt
2. Pour warm water over dry ingredients
3. Mix until all flour is absorbed (dough will be very wet and sticky)
4. Push dough toward center, cover tightly with plastic wrap
5. Place in a warm spot and let rise for 3 hours
6. Optional: Refrigerate overnight or up to 3 days
7. If refrigerated, bring to room temperature for 1 hour
8. Preheat oven to 450°F with dutch oven inside
9. Loosen dough from bowl with spatula, scraping inward
10. Dump on well-floured surface
11. Fold dough over itself a few times with scraper until it holds together
12. Flip so seam side is down. Shape into a round
13. Score an 'X' on top with sharp knife
14. Transfer to parchment paper, then to preheated dutch oven
15. Cover and bake 30 minutes
16. Uncover and bake 10-15 minutes more until deep golden
17. Cool on wire rack for about 1 hour before slicing

**Notes:**
- Use a scale to weigh flour for best results
- Dough should be extremely sticky - this creates the airy holes
- Be gentle when handling to preserve air bubbles
- Can freeze baked bread for up to 3 months
