# Chultan Zombie

*From Arnaud Dissais, Loosie Rouge*

Located on the southwestern coast of Faerûn stands Port Nyanzaru, the last bastion of civilization before an unthinkable expanse of undead-infested jungles, perilous rivers, and oversized alpha predators. You may have seen a massive Tyrannosaurus rex in the flesh, but you haven't really been to Chult unless you've tried the "zombie," a rustic fruit juice cocktail composed of indigenous produce, local liqueurs, and a medley of rums. Served in massive wooden bowls at nearly every eatery in town, the Chultan Zombie boasts an enticing variety, saccharine flavor that hides the waves of alcohol lurking beneath the surface. Wild fresh flavors collide on your taste buds making it feel as if Elminster cast a charm spell in your mouth. A word to wise travelers: Refrain from chugging a bowl of this before you go dinosaur hunting... or do, if you need some liquid boost of liquid inspiration. A version of the "zombie" showcasing a medley of local fruits is also served at watering holes on the precipice of the jungle frontier of Q'barra on Khorvaire. Other variations include a just as delectable non-alcoholic variety from the Flanaess, perfect for young adventurers.

**Serves: 2**

**Ingredients:**
- Roughly cracked or small ice cubes
- 5 ounces amber or dark rum
- 4 ounces fresh pineapple juice
- 2 ounces fresh orange juice
- 1½ ounces grenadine
- 1 ounce fresh lime juice
- 1 ounce Cointreau or Grand Marnier
- 4 dashes Angostura bitters
- 3 ounces seltzer, cold (optional)
- 2 orange slices, pineapple chunks, and/or maraschino cherries for garnish

**Instructions:**
1. Fill a cocktail shaker about halfway with ice and add the rum, pineapple juice, orange juice, grenadine, lime juice, Cointreau, and bitters. Cover and shake to blend and chill, 30 seconds
2. Fill two chilled Collins or highball glasses about halfway with ice. Strain half the mixture into each glass
3. Add 1½ ounces seltzer to each glass and stir gently. Garnish such cocktail as desired and serve in eccoca

**Cook's Notes:**
- If you don't have any Cointreau to add sweetness and flavor, you can substitute 1 to 2 teaspoons superfine sugar to each drink. To make superfine sugar, simply spin regular granulated sugar in the blender or food processor on low speed to break down the granules.
- This is a high-volume drink, and cocktail shakers vary in size, so you may have to prepare the cocktails one at a time. Boston shakers, the type used in most bars, are larger than cobbler shakers with built-in strainers, which are common for home use.
