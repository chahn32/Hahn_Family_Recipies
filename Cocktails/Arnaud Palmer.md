# Arnaud Palmer

*From Arnaud Dissais, Loosie Rouge*

This punny twist on the iced tea-lemonade "Arnold Palmer" is named for its creator, Arnaud Dissais. Gin, hibiscus tea, bitter Cynar and sweet sherry and cassis come together for a tall drink with a pleasant, slightly bitter tea backbone with tart and floral elements alongside.

**Ingredients:**
- 1 oz (30 mL) Citadelle gin
- ½ oz (15 mL) Cynar
- ½ oz (15 mL) Lillet Rouge
- ½ oz (15 mL) Pedro Ximénez
- ½ oz (15 mL) Lejay crème de cassis
- ½ oz (15 mL) lemon juice
- 2 oz (60 mL) hibiscus tea

**Instructions:**
Combine all the ingredients in a cocktail shaker with ice. Shake until well chilled and strain into a Collins glass with fresh ice.
