**Ingredients:**
- 1 (¼-oz) envelope active dry yeast (about 2¼ teaspoons)
- 2 teaspoons honey
- 2½ cups lukewarm water

3. Pour 4 tablespoons olive oil into large bowl that fits in refrigerator
4. Transfer dough to bowl and turn to coat in oil
5. Cover with silicone lid or plastic wrap
6. Chill until dough doubles in size and looks very bubbly, at least 8 hours and up to 1 day
7. Generously butter 13x9" baking pan (for thick focaccia) or 18x13" rimmed baking sheet (for thinner focaccia)
8. Pour 1 tablespoon oil into center of pan
9. Keeping dough in bowl, gather edges farthest from you and lift up and over into center
10. Repeat three more times, turning bowl 90 degrees each time (this gently deflates dough)

### Messinn-Style Plokkfiskur (Icelandic Fish & Potato Mash)
*The Ultimate Icelandic comfort food | Yields: 4 Servings | Prep: 15 min | Cook: 20 min*

**Ingredients:**
- 1 lb (500g) fresh cod or haddock, flaked
- 1 lb (500g) Yukon Gold potatoes, boiled and cubed
- 1 medium yellow onion, finely diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1½ cups whole milk (or half & half for extra creaminess)
- ½ teaspoon yellow curry powder
- Salt and white pepper to taste
- 1 cup shredded Gouda or Havarti cheese
- Fresh lime wedges and chopped chives for serving

**Instructions:**
1. **Prepare the Base:** Poach the fish in lightly salted water for 5-8 minutes until it flakes. Drain and set aside. Boil potatoes until tender, peel, and cut into ½-inch cubes
2. **Sauté Aromatics:** In a heavy skillet (cast iron preferred), melt the butter over medium heat. Sauté the onion until translucent. Add garlic and curry powder, stirring for 30 seconds
3. **Make the Béchamel:** Sprinkle flour over the onions and stir for 1 minute to cook out the raw flour taste. Slowly whisk in the milk until the sauce is thick and smooth
4. **Fold & Season:** Gently fold in the flaked fish and cubed potatoes. Be careful not to over-mash; you want some texture. Season generously with salt and white pepper
5. **The Gratin Finish:** Top with the shredded cheese. Place the skillet under the oven broiler for 3-5 minutes until the top is golden brown and bubbling
6. **Serve:** Add a squeeze of lime and serve immediately with dark rye bread and a thick slab of salted butter

**Notes:**
- Cast iron skillet works best for this dish
- Don't over-mash - maintaining some texture is key to authentic plokkfiskur

### Chultan Zombie
*From Arnaud Dissais, Loosie Rouge*

Located on the southwestern coast of Faerûn stands Port Nyanzaru, the last bastion of civilization before an unthinkable expanse of undead-infested jungles, perilous rivers, and oversized alpha predators. You may have seen a massive Tyrannosaurus rex in the flesh, but you haven't really been to Chult unless you've tried the "zombie," a rustic fruit juice cocktail composed of indigenous produce, local liqueurs, and a medley of rums. Served in massive wooden bowls at nearly every eatery in town, the Chultan Zombie boasts an enticing variety, saccharine flavor that hides the waves of alcohol lurking beneath the surface. Wild fresh flavors collide on your taste buds making it feel as if Elminster cast a charm spell in your mouth. A word to wise travelers: Refrain from chugging a bowl of this before you go dinosaur hunting... or do, if you need some liquid boost of liquid inspiration. A version of the "zombie" showcasing a medley of local fruits is also served at watering holes on the precipice of the jungle frontier of Q'barra on Khorvaire. Other variations include a just as delectable non-alcoholic variety from the Flanaess, perfect for young adventurers.

**Serves: 2**

**Ingredients:**
- Roughly cracked or small ice cubes
- 5 ounces amber or dark rum
- 4 ounces fresh pineapple juice
- 2 ounces fresh orange juice
- 1½ ounces grenadine
- 1 ounce fresh lime juice
- 1 ounce Cointreau or Grand Marnier
- 4 dashes Angostura bitters
- 3 ounces seltzer, cold (optional)
- 2 orange slices, pineapple chunks, and/or maraschino cherries for garnish

**Instructions:**
1. Fill a cocktail shaker about halfway with ice and add the rum, pineapple juice, orange juice, grenadine, lime juice, Cointreau, and bitters. Cover and shake to blend and chill, 30 seconds
2. Fill two chilled Collins or highball glasses about halfway with ice. Strain half the mixture into each glass
3. Add 1½ ounces seltzer to each glass and stir gently. Garnish such cocktail as desired and serve in eccoca

**Cook's Notes:**
- If you don't have any Cointreau to add sweetness and flavor, you can substitute 1 to 2 teaspoons superfine sugar to each drink. To make superfine sugar, simply spin regular granulated sugar in the blender or food processor on low speed to break down the granules.
- This is a high-volume drink, and cocktail shakers vary in size, so you may have to prepare the cocktails one at a time. Boston shakers, the type used in most bars, are larger than cobbler shakers with built-in strainers, which are common for home use.

## Salmon with Mushroom Sauce
*(From New York Times Cooking)*

**Ingredients:**
- One 1½ pound salmon fillet, or two 12-ounce fillets
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus about 1 teaspoon for the baking sheet
- Salt and freshly ground pepper
- 1 pound white or cremini mushrooms, rinsed briefly and wiped dry
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 shallots, minced
- 2 to 4 garlic cloves (to taste), minced
- 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme or rosemary (or a combination), or ½ to 1 teaspoon dried
- ¼ cup dry white wine, such as Sauvignon blanc

**Instructions:**

**Step 1:**
Preheat the oven to 300°F. Cover a baking sheet with foil and lightly oil the foil. Place the salmon on top. Season with salt and pepper. Fill a roasting pan with boiling water and place it on the oven floor.

**Step 2:**
Place the salmon in the oven and bake until the fish flakes and white bubbles of protein appear on the surface, 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the size of the fillets. Remove from the heat.

**Step 3:**
Meanwhile, cook the mushrooms. Heat a large, heavy frying pan over medium-high heat and add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. When the oil is hot (you can feel the heat when you hold your hand above the pan), add the mushrooms and cook, stirring or tossing in the pan, for a few minutes, until they begin to soften and sweat. Add the remaining oil, turn the heat to medium, and add the shallots, garlic, and herbs. Stir together, add 1/2 teaspoon salt and freshly ground pepper to taste, and cook, stirring often, for another 1 to 2 minutes, until the shallots and garlic have softened and the mixture is fragrant. Add the wine and cook, stirring often and scraping the bottom of the pan, until the wine has just about evaporated. Taste and adjust seasonings. Remove from the heat.

Gently transfer to prepared pan. Bake for 40 to 50 minutes or until center is almost set. (A small area in the center may still appear moist and jiggly; this will set up while the cheesecake is cooling.)

Remove cheesecake from oven, turn temperature up to 425°F (220°C) and pour sour cream mixture evenly on top. Return cheesecake to oven for 5 to 7 minutes.
