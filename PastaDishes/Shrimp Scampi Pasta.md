## Notes

- **Friday comfort**: Fancy but fast. 28g protein + healthy carbs!
- Don't overcook shrimp - they cook very quickly and become rubbery if overcooked
- Can substitute chicken broth for white wine
- Add cherry tomatoes or spinach for extra vegetables
- Adjust garlic to your preference (more is usually better!)
