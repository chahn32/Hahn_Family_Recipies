# Creamy Mushroom Pasta Bake

*Prep: 15 min | Cook: 45 min | Total: 1 hr | Serves: 4-6*

**For the Roasted Mushrooms:**
- 1½ pounds baby bella mushrooms, quartered
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 3 tablespoons fresh thyme
- ¼ cup olive oil

**Remaining Ingredients:**
- 1 pound rigatoni
- ¾ pound ricotta
- ½ pound fontina cheese, shredded
- ¾ cup heavy cream
- 8 ounces baby spinach, steamed and drained
- 2 cloves garlic, paste
- ½ cup Parmigiano Reggiano, divided
- 1 pinch nutmeg (optional)

**Instructions:**
1. Preheat oven to 450°F with racks at second-lowest and middle positions
2. Toss mushrooms with olive oil, thyme, salt, and pepper. Spread on baking sheet
3. Roast on lower rack 15-20 minutes until well browned
4. Meanwhile, boil salted water and cook rigatoni until very al dente (2 minutes less than package directions)
5. Cook spinach 30 seconds in boiling water, drain, squeeze out water, and chop
6. In large bowl, mix spinach, nutmeg, cream, ricotta, fontina, ¼ cup Parmigiano, garlic, and roasted mushrooms
7. Add pasta and mix. Taste and adjust seasoning
8. Transfer to 9x13 baking dish. Top with remaining Parmigiano
9. Bake 15 minutes covered (use parchment then foil to prevent sticking)
10. Remove covering and bake 5 minutes more until golden
11. For more color, broil 1-2 minutes (watch carefully)
12. Wait 15 minutes before serving

**Notes:**
- Makes 4 very large or 6 normal servings
- Undercook pasta since it cooks more in oven
- Drain spinach well to prevent watery pasta
- Leftovers keep 3 days in fridge
