# Spaghetti Casserole

*Easy baked spaghetti casserole*

## Ingredients

- Cook 7½ ounces spaghetti
- Brown 1 pound ground beef with ½ medium onion
- Then add 1 can cream of mushroom soup

## Instructions

1. Place spaghetti and ground beef mixture in layers in a greased casserole
2. Cover with Velveeta cheese and over the top of this pour 6 ounce can tomato sauce
3. Bake 350° oven for 30 minutes
4. I bake this with lid on the casserole to keep the cheese from getting too brown, especially good with grilled, pearl and green salad

## Notes

- Simple layered casserole
- Uses Velveeta for creamy cheese layer
- Keep covered during baking to prevent cheese from over-browning
